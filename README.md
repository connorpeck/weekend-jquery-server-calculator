# Server Side Calculator

## Description

In this project I created a webpage that takes in two numbers and one operator sign from the user. It gets sent over and modified on the server, to be specific it does the requested calculation and then sends that modified information back to the dom where the user can see the result. It also prints out a history of each chosen calculation. 

I solved the problem of figuring out how to connect routes so information can be stored and handled without the client side having access to the information? 

I solved this problem using node/express.
